#### Example - positioned badge {#ExampleBadgeSpecial}

Badges can be placed above other elements with the use of few Tailwind classes. For example `absolute top-0 right-0 -translate-y-1/2 translate-x-1/2` classes will put badge in the top right corner of the containg element. `Position` prop can be also be used which is just shortcut to add these classes to badge automatically. However, if you need more control over placement use classes directly.

#### Example - animated badge {#ExampleBadgeAnimated}

To animate badge one time on value update use `update-key` prop. For persistent animation you can use one of the Tailwind animate classes.
